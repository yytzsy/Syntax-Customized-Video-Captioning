# Syntax-Customized-Video-Captioning
Code for the TPAMI paper: "Syntax Customized Video Captioning by Imitating Exemplar Sentences". This is my second work on generating syntax customized video captions with exemplar sentences. The code is similar to the ACM MM 2020 work, please refer the repository [https://github.com/yytzsy/SMCG/](https://github.com/yytzsy/SMCG/) for more details.
